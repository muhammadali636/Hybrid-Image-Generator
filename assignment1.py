#Spatial-Domain Blending (using Gaussian/Laplacian pyramids)
#Frequency-Domain Blending (using FFT-based filtering)


#The transformed (and possibly warped) version of image2.jpg so that it aligns with image1.jpg.

#Spatial-Domain Hybrid: spatial_hybrid.jpg The final hybrid image created using Gaussian/Laplacian pyramid techniques.

#Frequency-Domain Hybrid: frequency_hybrid.jpg. The final hybrid image created using frequency-domain (FFT-based) filtering.
